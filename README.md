# AdvA-ResNet-LSTM

# Requirements
macbook pro Ventura 13.5
Python 3.10.12

Tensorflow-deps 2.9.0
Tensorflow-macos 2.9.0
Tensorflow-metal 0.5.0

Numpy 1.23.3

To run the proposed AdvA-ResNet-LSTM, ResNet-LSTM,Adv-ALSTM, ALSTM, and LSTM on the ACL18 and KDD17 dataset, you have to have the environment I mentioned above, and open a terminal run the commands in the hyperparameter file.

saved_model contains the model we have already trained.
Run the 'graph.ipynb', you can get the graphs we used in the paper, other graphs we used in graph file.

resnet1.py, residual_clock1.py, load.py, evaluator.py are all files that used in adva_resnet_lstm.py and adva_resnet_lstm34.py

Please go to blackboard to get the data source.
